# Consecutive-Composite-Numbers

This is a little program I developed to find the first sequence of n consecutive composite numbers. 

A composite number is any number that is not prime, and a prime number is any number greater than 1 that is only divisible by itself and 1. 

Enter the length of the sequence of consecutive composite numbers you wish to find, and the program will return the starting and ending numbers in the first sequence of at least this length (inclusive). 

I wrote this to solve an extra credit problem in my number theory class for university. I was tasked with finding the first sequence of 100 composite numbers, which is pretty difficult to do by hand (it ends up starting at 370,262 and ending at 370,361). Fortunately, I know how to code.
